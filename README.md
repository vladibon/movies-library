## About our project

What is ideal option to spend dark and cold autumn evening? Of course by watching great movie! Using
our web page you can easily find your favourite movie by entering it's name into search form. Also
if you haven't decided yet what do you want to watch, you can check our Popular movies sections,
which are two: sorted by current day and last week. Active page pagination will help you to monitor
where exactly in your search you are right now and return to something interesting you saw on other
page.

After you found something for you, you can read basic info about the movie by clicking on movie card
and opening modal window. Also there is an option to watch trailer, so it is easier to decide if you
like the movie or not. And if you do, you can save it for later to your library under the list
Queue, and if you already have watched the film there is Watched list for it too. You can easily
toggl those buttons and movie will stay in your library with the correct watched/queue state.

Lately every web site must have theme toggl, because after the whole day of screen time your eyes
are exhausted and need rest. Of course you can switch page theme to dark or back to light if you
want.

On smaller screen devises there is a helping button, which appears after you have scrolled down the
library a bit, so you can quickly go to the page top. Also if you are using the site on retina
display, you will get the best quality images, while other devices save traffic and get optimal
resolution images.

If you are interested about developers team, you can find an info about them in cute slider modal by
clicking on link in footer.
